# UrsaManus TODO (Current Next)

This file tracks the immediate next systems planned for UrsaManus.

## Next Features

- Save/load system (MVP): autosave progress and restore on refresh
- Add default reusable style primitives: provide baseline utility styles/tokens for common UI elements (especially buttons) to speed up feature styling.
- Add input-mapping template + cheat sheet: include copy/paste examples for wiring key input and on-screen controls, with primary coverage for compass button actions.

## Notes

These items are intentionally scoped as modular additions so the engine remains small at its core and extensible over time.
