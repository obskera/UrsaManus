# UrsaManus TODO (Current Next)

This file tracks the immediate next systems planned for UrsaManus.

## Next Features

- No active feature phases currently tracked.
- Add the next roadmap item here when work begins.

## Recently Completed

- Added default reusable style primitives (`um-*`) with baseline utility tokens/classes for common UI elements.
- Added input-mapping templates + cheat sheets (docs + reusable helper APIs) for key/on-screen controls with compass-focused coverage.
- Completed save/load MVP implementation (foundation, quick save, import/export, UX wiring, and hardening).
- Added complete save/load documentation pack:
    - `docs/save/README.md` (workflows + snippets)
    - `docs/save/CHEATSHEET.md` (quick-reference)
    - `src/services/save/README.md` (internal module guide)

## Documentation Map

- [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) — practical usage patterns and examples
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) — system responsibilities and lifecycle flow
- [save/README.md](save/README.md) — save/load implementation walkthrough
- [save/CHEATSHEET.md](save/CHEATSHEET.md) — save/load quick reference

## Notes

These items are intentionally scoped as modular additions so the engine remains small at its core and extensible over time.
